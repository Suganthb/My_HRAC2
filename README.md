Attendance , Hall Booking , Access and Reservation  
Hello everone here i created an android applicatin for my 2nd year project
its like a hall booking , attendance mark and reservation .
its app work in mobile or tab that will put outside of the lecture hall 
so here what is inside
* first it will get current date and get current time and ahow the current ongoing lecture its going on the particular lecture hall
* and if ur changing lecture hall or date or time then it will show that particular part lecture on going
* then its second page we consider its attendance part so here its an rifd scanner part join in the mobile or tab part , we give rfid students card 
  for students (like university inbuilt rifid card) then when they are enter lecture hall and scan part in here it will check first particula 
  rfid number is assign for rfid section and then check its student one or lecture one then its will get current its going then he assign for
  the subject therfe after he get access.
* he cant make 2nd access at same lecture at same time its flag one if he scan 2nd time its shows that he mark attendance already
* then we he went another lecture he didnt have pass so if he scans its show that ur not for this lecture 
* he can make book lecture halls for other events its show and free time and if he booked it will go to people who is the main to that filed they can make access
* and also here i created access specific person like director he can go any lecture hall wihout access.
* so in that app students can see their attendace percentage for there specific part

thanks what i included
